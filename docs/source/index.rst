Welcome to Relezoo's documentation!
===================================

**ReleZoo** (/lu'make/) is a Python library/SDK to run and develop Reinforcement Learning (RL)
algorithms.

It is basically an opinionated abstraction of the several aspects RL experimentation might have
to make easier to run and try out new experiments. I developed this as a way to help me
learn about RL coming from a more traditional SWE background.

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
